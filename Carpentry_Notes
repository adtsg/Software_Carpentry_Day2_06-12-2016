New stuff learnt from Software Carpentary Workshop
# Use explainshell finding out meaning of commands
# wordcount: use wc 
# nano text editor
# less
# word count of all the files: wc -l *.pdb
# > character which redirects the output to a filename
# sort -n (sorts files according to the counts the files have)
# | pipe character: you make a pipe to feed output of one into input of another. you 
bypass many steps in this case...convenient.You can then give a function to this 
workflow and basically create your own workflow. Whenever you use | , it has to be 
followed by a command (like sort or head or less).
# Call command
# grep command..you can grep the output into a pipe output
# cut command: calls one column # check in explain shell for fields and delimiters
# sed 's/=/,/' where s =substitute,= is the sign you want to change , is the sign you 
want to change to
